## Mock up of a electronic health records software for physical therapists

NOTE: This project is not intended to be used professionally and is only for educational purposes as it does not provide security to HIPAA. 

NOTE: I have removed deleting permissions and only reading and writing are allowed for demonstration purposes. If you would like to have deleting permissions, you will need to clone this project and set up your own Firebase account and modify permissions there.

This project uses my google firebase account to store and fetch data.

- Create/delete patient caseload
- Write up evals for new patients
- Document daily intervention treatments
- Provide billing for each daily note
- Delete daily notes as needed
